**Day Nineteen - 30 days of React challenge - "Party RSVP" app**

An interface which collects and holds user RSVP's for a party.

**Concepts Explored:**
- Conditional Rendering
- Passing data from child to parent
- Handline data flow

Follow me *programming noob* as I stumble my way through self-learning React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned. By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!
